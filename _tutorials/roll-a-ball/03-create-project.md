## Starting Your First Project

Let's create a new Unity project for our Roll-a-Ball game. This project will contain all the assets, scenes, and scripts we'll need.

### Step-by-Step Guide

3. Select "3D" template
4. Name your project "Roll-a-Ball"
5. Choose a location to save your project
6. Click "Create"

&lt;/div&gt;

### Project Structure
Once created, Unity will open your new project with the default sample scene. Familiarize yourself with the main Unity interface:

- **Scene View:** Where you build your game visually
- **Game View:** Preview of what the player will see
- **Hierarchy:** List of all GameObjects in your scene
- **Inspector:** Properties of the selected GameObject
- **Project Window:** All your project assets and files

  <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use a dedicated folder for all your Unity projects to keep them organized.
